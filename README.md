# Steps
blockMesh                     # Create a background block 
surfaceFeatureExtract         # Extract features
snappyHexMesh -overwirte      # Snappy the geometry from background NOTE: It may takes 20 min to have it finished. Ignore the warning of displacement.
topoSet                       # Define the faceSet
createPatch                   # Create boundary patches from
setExprFields                 # Set Initial surface displacement
decomposePar                  # Divide 80 regions for parallel computation 
bsub < interFoam.sh           # send to HPC system and run
